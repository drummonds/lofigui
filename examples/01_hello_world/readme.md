# Hello World

This is put into a single file apart from the HTML

This has more infrastructure than I would like, however you could remove it but as soon as the project becomes real you will start adding it back.

PS something odd with caching of poetry versions possible due to WS bug on datatimes.  poetry is not updating versions.

## Run the demo

In this directory:
```
poetry update
poetry run python hello.py
```
